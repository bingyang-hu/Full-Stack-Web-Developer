# Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp


* What I did in this course:

  * Used **HTML** to create website content
  * Used **CSS** to create beautifully styled sites
  * Used **Javascript** to interact with sites on the Front-End
  * Used **Django** as a back end for the websites
  * Created a fully functional web site called 'Star Social' using the Full-Stack with Django 3.1.2
  
* Final Project:

  1. My Blog Site
  2. Social Media Site


> The version of Django inside the lectures is 1.1.1 while what I use is 3.1.2, therefore some changes need to be made during the projects. Refer to [Notes.md](https://github.com/bingyang-hu/Full-Stack-Web-Developer/blob/master/Django/Notes.md) to check the details.
